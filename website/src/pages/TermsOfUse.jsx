            <h2>1. How We Make the Platform Available</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
                This is a contract between you and Provable. You must read and
                agree to these Terms before using the Platform. If you do not
                agree, you may not use the Platform. You may use the Platform
                only if you can form a legally binding contract with us, and
                only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local,
                state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations
                (“Applicable Law”). Without limiting the generality of the
                foregoing, any access to, or use of, the Platform by anyone who
                is a minor (which is under the age of 18 in most jurisdictions)
                in any applicable jurisdiction (a “Minor”) is strictly
                prohibited and in violation of these Terms, unless such access
                and/or use is supervised by a parent or legal guardian
                (“Parent”) who: (a) has read and understands these Terms; (b)
                approves all rights granted, and all obligations undertaken, by
                the Minor hereunder; and (c) agrees to be bound by these Terms.
                If you are a Parent of a User who is a Minor, then, by allowing
                such Minor to access and/or use the Platform, you are subject to
                these Terms and responsible for such Minor’s activity on the
                Platform. With respect to the Parent of a User who is a Minor,
                “you,” as used in these Terms in the context of a license grant,
                assignment, restriction, obligation, acknowledgment,
                representation, warranty, or covenant, or in any similar
                context, means “the Parent, on behalf of the Parent and the
                Minor,” and “your” has the corresponding meaning. The Platform
                is not available to any Users we previously removed from the
                Platform.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Users; Accounts</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>(a) User Accounts.</strong> We may maintain accounts for
                Users of the Platform that give you access to certain services
                and functionalities that we may, in our sole discretion,
                establish and maintain as part of the Platform from time to time
                (“User Accounts”). You acknowledge that, notwithstanding
                anything to the contrary herein, you do not own your User
                Account, nor do you possess any rights to data stored by or on
                behalf of Provable on the servers running the Platform. We may
                maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of
                Users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>(b) Connecting Via Third-Party Services.</strong> By
                connecting to the Platform via a third-party service, you give
                us permission to access and use your information from that
                service, as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in
                or access credentials for that service.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>(c) Account Security.</strong> You may never use another
                User’s User Account without such User’s permission. When
                creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and
                complete information, and you must keep this information up to
                date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on
                your User Account, you will keep your User Account password(s)
                and/or any other authentication credentials secure, and you will
                not share your password(s) and/or any other authentication
                credentials with anyone else. We encourage you to use “strong”
                passwords (e.g., passwords that use a combination of upper- and
                lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) to protect your User
                Account. We will not be liable for, and expressly disclaim
                liability for, any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your
                User Account and/or any changes to your User Account, including,
                without limitation, changes made by another User that is granted
                access to your User Account. You will notify us immediately of
                any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>(d) Account Settings.</strong> You may control certain
                aspects of your User Account and any associated User profile,
                and of the way you interact with the Platform, by changing the
                settings in your settings page. By providing us with your email
                address, you consent to our using that email address to send you
                Platform-related notices, including any notices required by
                Applicable Law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Changes, Suspension, and Termination</h3>
            <p>
                You may deactivate your User Account at any time. We may, with
                or without prior notice, change the Platform, stop providing the
                Platform or features of the Platform to you or to Users
                generally, or create usage limits for the Platform. We may, with
                or without prior notice, permanently terminate or temporarily
                suspend your access to your User Account and/or the Platform
                without liability, with or without cause, and for any or no
                reason, including if, in our sole determination, you violate any
                provision of these Terms. Upon their termination for any reason
                or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.
            </p>

            <h3>1.4 Your Interactions with Other Users</h3>
            <p>
                YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING
                SHARING OF INFORMATION, WITH OTHER USERS. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT,
                BUT HAVE NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND
                OTHER USERS. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM
                YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS, AND FOR ANY USER’S ACTION OR
                INACTION, INCLUDING RELATING TO USER CONTENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).

            <h2>2. Access to the Platform; Platform Restrictions</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Access to the Platform</h3>
            <p>
                Subject to your compliance with these Terms and any
                documentation we may make available to you, you are hereby
                granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, and freely
                revocable right to access and use the Platform, solely for your
                personal use or internal business purposes, as applicable,
                strictly as permitted by the features of the Platform. We may
                terminate the license granted in this Section at any time, for
                any reason or no reason. We reserve all rights not expressly
                granted herein in and to the Platform.

                    sends more request messages to the servers running the
                    Platform than a human can reasonably produce in the same

            </h2>
            <p>
                13.1 Governing Law. You agree that: (a) the Platform will be
                deemed solely based in the State of Delaware; and (b) the
                Platform will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to
                personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in
                jurisdictions other than Delaware. These Terms will be governed
                by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware,
                without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties
                acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving
                interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences
                with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the
                Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be
                amended, “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of
                the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and
                laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by
                Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue
                that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then
                that issue will be resolved under 11 and governed by the law of
                the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or the
                jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us. The
                application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
                the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree
                to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal
                and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which
                we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
                in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
                threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our
                data security, Confidential Information, or Intellectual
                Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement
                below, including any provisional relief required to prevent
                irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and
                exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for
                trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration
                Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. These Terms were
                drafted in the English language and this English language
                version of the Terms is the original, governing instrument of
                the understanding between you and us. In the event of any
                conflict between the English version of these Terms and any
                translation, the English version will prevail.

                REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE
                MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Arbitration
                Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or
                claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to,
                directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the
                formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement,
                interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (ii)
                access to or use of the Platform, including receipt of any

                without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted
                before or after your consent to these Terms.

                Dispute-Resolution Process. For any Claim, you will first
                contact us at legal@provable.com attempt to resolve the Claim
                with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been
                able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to
                resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by
                JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the
                Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for
                JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be
                contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available. In
                the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration
                Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The
                arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live
                (if applicable) or Sussex County, Delaware, unless you and
                Provable agree otherwise. If you are using the Platform for
                commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying
                any JAMS filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in
                accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the
                Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable
                attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other
                witnesses. If you are an individual using the Platform for
                non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee
                for the initiation of your case, unless 12 you apply for and
                successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award
                rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of
                arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your
                reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you
                may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction
                without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not
                absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
                resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
                Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any
                federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive
                authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope,
                interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of
                this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any
                part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
                Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all
                threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to
                whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms
                is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration,
                including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or
                estoppel.</p>
                <p> (d) Equitable Relief. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION
                AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING
                INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS
                NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT,
                MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY,
                CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR
                PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT,
                PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER
                REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL
                (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.
                </p>
                <p>(E)
                Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void,
                unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void,
                unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will
                be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful
                provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the
                remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will
                remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel
                arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis
                pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the
                foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found
                to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part,
                because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive
                relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such
                relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration
                and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.
                All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this
                Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and
                the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the
                entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending
                the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. </p>

                AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
                CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND
                PROVABLE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN
                INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
                RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT
                AFFECT OTHER USERS.
